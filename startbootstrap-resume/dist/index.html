                    <p class="lead mb-5"> I have been a virtual client support specialist for over 6 years. As an experienced virtual client support specialist, I have handled a multitude of complex issues in a timely manner and found creative solutions, providing an exceptional client experience. In providing an exceptional client experience with routine troubleshooting for common issues with video, phone, data, home security, and cellular services via phone and real-time chat, I have offered tailored product solutions based on customer needs and budgets. I have acted as a subject matter expert on all lines of business, such as cable, telephony, home based internet, home automation system and mobile phone services, for both teammates and clients alike.
                    <br>
                    <p>My professional development recently drew me closer to the social space and providing customer solutions in near real-time. My projects played a critical role in assisting customers on online forums by way of self-help. I am also involved in several employee resource groups during my tenure. This experience has allowed me to participate in a group environment outside of my day-to-day responsibilities while allowing me to exercise my leadership and time management skills.
