I enjoy attending and participating in cosplaying different characters such as Catwoman or Harley Quinn from the DC Universe or Black Widow from the Marvel Universe and attending the Renaissance Festival each year.

                        <p> At Comcast/Xfinity, I volunteered with an Employee Resource Group (ERG) whose purpose is to enhance employee engagement by creating an environment where everyone &mdash; including 2SLGBTQIA+ employees and their allies &mdash; is comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work every day. The ERG provides leadership, networking, development, and volunteer opportunities to its 2SLGBTQIA+ and straight&mdash;ally members. The ERG contributes to an 2SLGBTQIA+ aware and inclusive culture and supports Comcast's goal of attracting, developing, retaining, and engaging diverse talent.

                            Project Refit is changing the negative connotation around getting mental health support. They are doing this by implementing and supporting simple, make-sense programs for military members (past/present) and first responders. They incorporate family into these programs, as well. Whether you need someone to vent to or help you get yourself out of your head and not keep you alone with your own thoughts, I'm here to be that person if you need someone.
